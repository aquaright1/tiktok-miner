# Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md
-   Keep track of code structure and code reference under /docs/project-structure.md
-   Keep track of all of the common codes and functions and explain their usage under /docs/code-reference.md
# DB changes
1. Please dont run any thing that could delete data from db!
2. Never ever try to reset the db! `bun prisma migrate reset --force` or any force reset command is your enemy!
3. Backup db before running any major changes on db. `bun run cli backup-db`

# Typescript standards
Dont use mts, just use ts.
Dont use .js import! Dont do things like `import { saveResults } from '../../../lib/utils/output.js';`

# Shadcn UI
Stick with shadcn@2.1.8.
Please use `bunx --bun shadcn@2.1.8 add xxx` to add shadcn components.

# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

-   .env files
-   \*_/config/secrets._
-   \*_/_.pem
-   Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

-   Never commit sensitive files
-   Use environment variables for secrets
-   Keep credentials out of logs and output

# TS Runtime
Always use bun instead of using node.
That including running, building, testing, installing dependencies, etc.
Dont put `"type": "module",` under package.json.

# Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

2. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval
   - If a lint rule needs to be disabled, ask the user first and explain why
   - Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling the lint rule
   - Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason

# Testing
Always test the code before finishing the task.

## UI Changes
For any UI changes, please test the UI on dev server.
Please dont always trying to fire up new server. Always assume dev server is running on localhost:3000.

## Command Line Tool
If you are making changes to the command line tool, test the command before finishing the task, use LOG_LEVEL=debug if needed. Also update [README.md](http://README.md) if needed.

## DB changes
For any operations on db, test the result on `bun run cli query-db`
* Please dont alter the db directly by using query-db cli!*


# Logging
Please use logger.ts for logging.
