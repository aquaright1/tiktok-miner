# Implementing GitHub Actions for Testing and Coverage Reporting

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project needed a reliable way to ensure code quality through automated testing. This includes running tests on every code change and tracking test coverage metrics over time. We needed a solution that:

1. Integrates with our GitHub repository
2. Works with our Bun-based testing setup
3. Provides visibility into test coverage
4. Archives test results for future reference
5. Requires minimal maintenance

## Decision

We decided to implement a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests and report coverage. The workflow:

1. Runs on every push to main/master branches and pull requests
2. Sets up the Bun runtime environment
3. Runs tests with coverage using `bun test --coverage`
4. Reports coverage to Codecov for visualization and tracking
5. Archives coverage reports as GitHub Action artifacts

We also implemented a configuration file for Codecov (`codecov.yml`) to customize the coverage reporting.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins CI**: More customizable but requires dedicated infrastructure and maintenance.
2. **CircleCI/Travis CI**: Good alternatives but GitHub Actions provides tighter integration with our repository.
3. **Manual Testing Only**: Not scalable and prone to human error.
4. **Alternative Coverage Tools**: Considered other coverage platforms but Codecov offers good free tier support for open-source projects and GitHub integration.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Automated testing on every code change ensures code quality
- Coverage reporting helps identify untested code paths
- Developers can quickly see if their changes break any tests
- Historical coverage data helps track progress over time
- Coverage artifacts provide detailed reports for debugging

### Negative

- Adds complexity to the repository setup
- External dependency on Codecov service
- Slight increase in CI execution time

### Neutral

- Requires developers to be mindful of coverage metrics
- May need adjustments as the project evolves

## Implementation

1. Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` workflow file
2. Configure the workflow to run tests and report coverage
3. Create `codecov.yml` for Codecov configuration
4. Update documentation in README.md and project-structure.md
5. Create a dedicated testing.md document
6. Set up Codecov integration with the GitHub repository

## Related Decisions

- Choice of Bun as the JavaScript runtime and test runner
- Project structure and organization

## Notes

- Codecov requires an account and a token for private repositories
- The current setup is optimized for a Bun-based project
- Repository secrets may need to be configured for Codecov token
