# Location Filter Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated `getCandidates` function** in `/app/app/actions.ts`:
   - Added `location` parameter to the function signature
   - Added location filtering condition using Prisma's `contains` with case-insensitive mode
   - Combined location conditions with existing search and tag conditions

2. **Updated `getATSCandidates` function** in `/app/app/actions/ats.ts`:
   - Added `location` parameter to the function signature
   - Added location filtering to the query when location is provided
   - Imported `Prisma` from `@prisma/client` for QueryMode access

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Candidates Page** in `/app/app/candidates/page.tsx`:
   - Added `locationFilter` state variable
   - Added location parameter to the SWR hook
   - Added location input field with SearchInput component
   - Shows current location filter when active

2. **Updated ATS Page** in `/app/app/ats/page.tsx`:
   - Added `locationFilter` state variable
   - Updated `loadCandidates` function to accept location parameter
   - Updated useEffect dependencies to include locationFilter
   - Added location input field with SearchInput component
   - Shows current location filter when active

## How It Works

1. **Database**: The `GithubUser` table already has a `location` field that stores location data from GitHub profiles

2. **Filtering**: When a location filter is provided:
   - The backend uses Prisma's `contains` operator with case-insensitive mode
   - This allows partial matching (e.g., "China" will match "Beijing, China")
   - The filter is applied in addition to any existing search or tag filters

3. **User Interface**:
   - Users can enter location text in the input field and press Enter to apply
   - The filter persists across page navigation within the same session
   - Users can clear the filter by submitting an empty value

## Examples

- Filter by country: "China", "United States", "Germany"
- Filter by city: "Beijing", "San Francisco", "Berlin"
- Filter by region: "Asia", "Europe", "Remote"
- Partial matches work: "York" will match "New York"

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Navigate to the Candidates page (`/candidates`)
2. Enter a location in the "Location Filter" field (e.g., "China")
3. Press Enter to apply the filter
4. Verify that only candidates with matching locations are displayed

The same functionality is available on the ATS page (`/ats`) for filtering pipeline candidates by location.
